<a href="http://www.twice.com/news/statistics/one-third-homes-primed-smart-home-technology/59882" target="_blank">In 2015 alone</a>,Â the number of U.S. households with smart home technology grew almost 30 percent,Â equating to a market size of $21.9 billion.Â With such significant growth, the potential for expansion in 2016 is greater than ever; and with growth comes new industries and verticals that smart technology will embrace.

That's why we've had our eye on the coolest smart home products that are set to arrive in your household this year.Â From smart glasses to smell alarms and everything in between, our list features products from CES 2016, CNET and more.

Read on for theÂ 8 Coolest Smart Home Products Coming in 2016.

<h2><a href="https://ideaing.com/product/sensorwake" target="_blank">Sensorwake</a></h2>
&nbsp;

<a href="https://ideaing.com/product/sensorwake" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4609" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/02/SensorWake.jpg" alt="SensorWake" width="500" height="500" /></a>

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">We've all seen the smart home alarms that wake you up gently, with soft music and lighting; this product is different. The Sensorwake alarm forgoes sound to wake you up using smell.Â No more alarms, no more ear-piercing noises. Instead, you can be woken up by the scents of chocolate, espresso, sea side, lush jungle and more. Now that's interesting.</p>
<strong>What Users Are Saying...</strong>

Available for pre-order now, users are excited about this product. No one likes to be woken up by alarms, right? We're waiting with anticipation to see how this works in action.

<strong>Why We Chose It...</strong>

We would often be concerned about the chemicals involved in scent, but this product isÂ certified by the most demanding air quality organizations (REACH, CARB and IFRA Certified). It also sounds very easy to use; allÂ you have to do is plug in a cartridge, each with a different smell, and the alarm will diffuse for three minutes at the set time.Â We're interested to see how this product works for heavy sleepers.

&nbsp;
<h2><a href="https://ideaing.com/product/the-dash-bragi" target="_blank">Bragi Dash Earphones</a></h2>
&nbsp;

<a href="https://ideaing.com/product/the-dash-bragi" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1263" src="https://d3f8t323tq9ys5.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/02/img-1491-1200-wm-1.jpg" alt="bragi" width="791" height="500" /></a>

&nbsp;

This is an audio product we're excited about. The Bragi Dash wireless earbuds are geared toward sports - they're waterproof, noise cancelling, track your activity - and of course, you can listen to music, too. Â It's catered toward the triathlete,Â and are great wireless headphones that break new ground.

<strong>What Users Are Saying...</strong>

Bragi is trulyÂ taking off. From humble beginnings on Kickstarter to announcing a partnership with Vodafone in 2016, it's ready for prime time.

<strong>Why We Chose It...</strong>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The greatest feature of this project isÂ the Dashâ€™s Near Field Magnetic Induction technology. This allows the earbuds to communicate with each other, which means that you can use gestures to do simple actions like answer a phone call byÂ nodding your head. Â It's a truly connected device.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><a href="https://ideaing.com/product/prizm" target="_blank">Prizm Speaker</a></h2>
&nbsp;

<a href="https://ideaing.com/product/prizm" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1266" src="https://d3f8t323tq9ys5.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/02/Prizm-Speaker.jpg" alt="Prizm-Speaker" width="587" height="500" /></a>

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">This speaker is innovative on the market, and truly understands how music impacts your soul. The Prizm is Bluetooth connected and can play music from all your streaming accounts - Apple Music, Spotify, and more. The difference with this product is that the moment you walk into the room, music will start playing and will continue to learn more and more about you as you skip music, play it again, and perform other learned behaviors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What Users Are Saying...</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Interested users can request their exclusive invite now. The first batch of products are expected to ship early this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why We Chose It...</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We love the connectivity with streaming accounts and the Prizm.Â When you hear something great, all you need to do is touch the heart button on the product and it's automatically added into a playlist so you can hear and enjoy it later.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ideaing.com/product/inboard-m1" target="_blank">M1 Inboard</a></h2>
&nbsp;

<a href="https://ideaing.com/product/inboard-m1" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1265" src="https://d3f8t323tq9ys5.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/02/boards.png" alt="m1 inboard" width="500" height="500" /></a>
<p style="text-align: left;">This California-based company has aimed to solve the main problem of the electric long board - running out of power, so you're unable to ride after the motor dies (that sucks). The approach the company has taken for this is the idea to place individual motors in each wheel, so it can be individually spun - meaning the user can ride this like a regular long board, if needed.</p>
<strong>What Users Are Saying...</strong>

Inboard has secured great ambassadors for the product, including skateboarderÂ Liam Morgan. In addition to being featured at CES, Ambassadors are going to help Inboard build great buzz for the product.

<strong>Why We Chose It...</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">The solution to fix the errors with the electric long board was an innovative idea, but this California-based company didn't just stop there.Â A replaceable battery pack is alsoÂ includedÂ within the deck, so you can swap out battery packs for a full charge. It also includes head lights and tail lights for safety.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ideaing.com/product/parrot-flower-power" target="_blank">Parrot Flower Power</a></h2>
&nbsp;

<a href="https://ideaing.com/product/parrot-flower-power" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1267" src="https://d3f8t323tq9ys5.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/02/Parrot-Pot.jpg" alt="parrot-pot" width="660" height="500" /></a>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes, keeping a plant alive can be difficult. As much as we excel in caring for ourselves, our pets and our children, why is a plant so darn difficult?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you're just as guilty of killing the number ofÂ houseplants as we have been, the Parrot Flower Power accessory is the best. It comes with a hidden ceramic pot that holds two liters of water and releases it through four water spouts. But how does it work? It uses the knowledge of more than 7,000 plants to detect when yours is thirsty and determines how much water should be released. Now that's cool.</p>
<strong>What Users Are Saying...</strong>

Those of us who love the outdoors and gardening, but don't necessarily have a green thumb, are pretty stoked for this product. Buzz online is high and we understand why.

<strong>Why We Chose It...</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">We love the analysis that comes with this product. You an getÂ data analysis and spot-on tips, while your diary helps plan your gardening by predicting when you need to water over the next couple of weeks. It's basically a genius living in your home.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ideaing.com/product/ossia-cota" target="_blank">Cota by Ossia Wireless Charging</a></h2>
&nbsp;

<a href="https://ideaing.com/product/ossia-cota" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1268" src="https://d3f8t323tq9ys5.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/02/ipowerimage.jpg" alt="Ossia cota" width="1000" height="500" /></a>

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">Wireless charging is being turned upside down with the Cota by Ossia. This product creates a truly wire-free experience, as it permitsÂ the transfer of up to 1 Watt of energy through the air to your device. Although it charges four times slower than conventional wires, this product is paving the way for the future of devices that never have to be plugged in to receive a full charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What Users Are Saying...</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Interest was high at CES this year, and it has since continued past the conference. The company has <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2016/tech-moves-ossia-avvo/">recently hired a new CEO</a>, and users are anticipating a great 2016 ahead for the product.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why We Chose It...</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So how does this this work? Featured at 2016 CES, Cota uses phased arrays in the Wi-Fi spectrum to send power between a charging base and a small receiver, meaning that your device can charge through the air instead of being connected to another device. It can power devices within a 30-foot radius. We're excited to see how this product expands, and impacts the future of connected, charging devices.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ideaing.com/product/bixi" target="_blank">Bixi Touchless Remote</a></h2>
&nbsp;

<a href="https://ideaing.com/product/bixi" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1269" src="https://d3f8t323tq9ys5.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/02/Gesture-Controlled-Bixi.jpg" alt="bixi" width="434" height="500" /></a>
<p style="text-align: left;">Imagine controlling your devices and apps without touching a smart phone? It's possible thanks to the Bixi. With crowd funding coming soon, and the product expected to be available in the later half of 2016, this is a small device that syncs with an app on your phone. The app can program eight hand gestures, such as 'up', 'down', 'swipe left', and more that will connect with your devices. For example, if you are reading an eBook, you can gesture to swipe left to turn the page.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What Users Are Saying...</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Forbes is almost as excited about this device as we are. "You donâ€™t even have to wash off the cake batter or touch the screen to skip to the next page", said Forbes Tech. Sounds like a winner to us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why We Chose It...</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We love that this device can be paired with<em> so many things</em>. For example, when you're riding your bike you can control music, the smart phone camera and more without taking your eyes off the road. When you're cooking in the kitchen, you can motion through your the recipe on your smart phone without getting your phone dirty. The ease of this product is what won us over.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ideaing.com/product/hamilton-beach-smoothie-smart-blender" target="_blank">Perfect Blend</a></h2>
&nbsp;

<a href="https://ideaing.com/product/hamilton-beach-smoothie-smart-blender" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1270" src="https://d3f8t323tq9ys5.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/02/Perfect-Blend.jpg" alt="perfect-bled" width="723" height="500" /></a>
<p style="text-align: left;">No measuring, great results, and foolproof perfection? Sounds like an ideal solution in our book. With the Perfect Blend products, you can create the perfect smoothie every single time.Â <span class="a-list-item">The scale automatically weighs each and every ingredient as you pour and even alerts you when to stop. Even better? But letting the product know which products you have in the fridge or on your counter, the app will tell you what you can make out of ingredients you have handy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>WhyÂ Users Are Saying...</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Users on Amazon are saying that this is a grown-up's toy (which we love). Many users say that this is a great gift for friends and family.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why We Chose It...</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We love that that this device will make a recipe out of the ingredients you have. All too often we have bananas that are days away from expiration, or avocados that are perfectly ripe. What better way to make a nutritious recipe out of what you already have?</p>


<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Â </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">CES 2016 delivered some innovative, consumer-friendly products, and we are so excited to see this technology unfold into the market. Smart home technology is ready to expand tenfold, set to experience significant growth over 2016 and into 2017. From wireless headphones that are ideal to use while you're running, to a blender that measures ingredients as you create a nutritious morning smoothie, to a wireless product that charges your smart phone and devices within 30 feet, innovative products are emerging on the market each and every week.</p>

In fact, having functioning smoke and carbon monoxide alarms is a requirement in many states today. Most traditional air monitors however, only alert people of a danger by making noise within the home, and itâ€™s a common misunderstanding, when people think the alarm going off automatically calls the fire department, which isn't always true.

This means that hearing the alarm is a requirement for contacting the authorities who can help save your home in an emergency. If you're not home to hear your alarm go off, it is effectively useless during times when you are away. The same applies to smart home security, which we cover <a href="https://ideaing.com/ideas/smart-home-security">here</a>.

Enter the smart home technology solution to air monitoring: smart Smoke &amp; Air Monitors.

&nbsp;

<strong>What Are Smart Smoke and Air Monitors?</strong>

These are devices which connect with your smartphone, usually via Wi-Fi, to update you about changes to your home's air quality and in some cases, even allow for remote control.

&nbsp;

<strong>Why You Need It</strong>

Many of these devices will help to save your home in a fire by alerting you of the danger while you are away. However, they can also be helpful for anyone who suffers from various allergies or is sensitive to high pollutants in the air and can truly create peace of mind when, say, you are in the office and your children are at home. You know your home is safe and that your family has a safe place to be, full of clean air.
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7315" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/onelinkdetect-250x250.jpg" alt="One LInk Detect" width="400" height="400" />OneLink works with your iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch</h5>
&nbsp;

<strong>Installation &amp; Ease of Use</strong>

Most of these products are easy to install and bring to full functionality. In fact, several of the devices below require little more than taking the item out of itâ€™s original packaging, downloading the corresponding app and connecting to you home Wi-Fi to become functional. However, there are always options out there for professionals to be hired to come and install these products for you. Especially if you decide to go with a product that requires replacing your entire existing smoke and carbon monoxide detector system.

&nbsp;

<strong>Cost</strong>

These products tend to have a wide and varying cost range. Depending on which product you choose, you can expect to pay anywhere between $50-$250. With that said, very few additional items (if any at all), are necessary for these product to function. Really the only other requirement is that you have in home Wi-Fi, (and of course a smart phone, but if youâ€™re looking into smart products, chances are you already have one!).
<p class="a-size-large a-spacing-none">Weâ€™ve chosen the following products based on their use of this new technology, customer reviews, and the unique ways they might help you monitor your home. Many of them have different functionalities, so you may find that having more than one of these products in your home is beneficial.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ideaing.com/product/birdi" target="_blank">Birdi Smart Detector</a></h2>

<a href="https://ideaing.com/product/birdi"><strong>Birdi Smart Detector ($119)</strong></a></div>
</div>
</div>
&nbsp;

A combination of many of the devices which follow, the Birdi is only available for pre-order at this time but has the potential to be a major player in this market. Users will be able to monitor smoke, carbon monoxide, air quality, and weather updates all from the same device. Can you imagine having all of this in a single device? I know I can, and I'll tell you, I'm excited about obtaining this for my home.

&nbsp;
<h4>What Users Are Saying</h4>
There are no product reviews for this item yet, but its preliminary buzz is strong. Check out their <a href="http://getbirdi.com/" target="_blank">website</a> for pre-ordering and news updates.

&nbsp;
<h4>Why You Should Get It</h4>
This is an up and coming device, and really seems like it could be a great all-in-one air monitoring solution. So if you are looking to stay on the cutting edge of smart home air monitoring and detection, this is a great option for you to consider.

&nbsp;
<h2><a href="https://ideaing.com/product/leeo-smart-alert" target="_blank">Leeo Smart Alert</a></h2>

</div>
</div>
&nbsp;

I've found the Leeo device to be a less expensive smoke and air monitoring option, which is certainly helpful for those of us with less extra money to spend, but a desire for a smart smoke/carbon monoxide detector. The reasoning for the price, is likely to due to the fact however, that this isn'tÂ a detector itself, but instead works by listening for the sounds of your existing smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. If an alarm sound is detected, the device alerts you through your smartphone so that you can take appropriate actions.

&nbsp;
<h4>What Users Are Saying</h4>
This product has a solid 3.9/5 rating from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leeo-Smart-Alert-iOS-Android/product-reviews/B00XMX4GUC/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_summary?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;sortBy=helpful" target="_blank">Amazon.com users</a>. Buyers say that the device works well for the basic function it provides, though setup can be difficult.

&nbsp;
<h4>Why You Should Get It</h4>
This is a solid alternative to the Nest device, if you're looking to spend less money and/or keep your existing monitoring system. It is also helpful for anyone who is looking for a device that offers simplicity in its usage.

</div>
</div>
&nbsp;

Moving into products whose primary focus is not smoke or carbon monoxide emergencies, the Foobot is a tabletop device that checks the level of pollution in the air in and around your home. With the device, I have found I'm able to track the air quality in my home, and become more knowledgeable about what I can do to improve my home's air health.

&nbsp;
<h4>What Users Are Saying</h4>
A 3.4/5 star rating comes from mostly solid reviews on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foobot-Indoor-Air-Quality-Monitor/product-reviews/B00XI32QYE/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_summary?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;sortBy=helpful" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>. Positive reviews note that this product is helpful when testing out new cleaning supplies and discovering if they make their homes more toxic.

&nbsp;
<h4>Why You Should Get It</h4>
A great choice for anyone who deals with allergies or who is sensitive to pollutants, this device will help you gain a better picture of how to improve the air you breathe on a daily basis.

</div>
</div>
&nbsp;

For an indoor/outdoor monitoring option, I've found the Netatmo is a fun device that helps you track changes in weather as well as in-home air concerns. What I think it the absolute coolest feature this device offered though, is the fact that it will make suggestions to you; like when you should open your windows to let some fresh air in, or which days are best to go outside and work on your garden.

Smart air monitoring is beneficial for a number of reasons. First and foremost, this is about <a href="https://ideaing.com/ideas/03/06/protecting-family-smart-tech" target="_blank">your family's safety and peace of mind</a>. You'll be able to remotely ensure that your home is safe at all times, which is especially important if you have pets who are left at home when you are away during the day. Additionally, new technology is allowing people to educate themselves about their air quality in ways that were impossible just a few years ago. The air you breathe impacts your health, so being knowledgeable about improving that air is invaluable.

The enjoyment of your home is directly related to how safe and secure you feel there. A home can be filled withÂ fun gadgets and beautiful decor, but that doesn't mean much if you don't feel that your family and belongings are safe.

How concerned should you be about home safety? In the FBI's most recent report on crime in the United States, over 1.7 million burglaries were reported annually and over 70% of those incidents took place on residential properties. Burglary is a legitimate problem, and one that hopefully you'll never have to experience. However, an ounce of prevention can go a long way in giving you peace of mind and in keeping predators from accessing your home.`

When my husband and I moved into our first house after years of apartment living, learning about home security quickly became an important priority. As exciting as it was to move into a bigger space, and to have more privacy, that came with losing our doorman and the security of having neighbors right down the hall! We've spent a lot of time researching options within the home security market, and were excited to see how many smart security products areÂ available today.

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3509" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/19-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></p>
&nbsp;

Having a home security system is the most logical addition to your home where safety is concerned.

&nbsp;
<h2>About Home Security Systems</h2>
&nbsp;

Home security systems are devices designed to protect your home fromÂ burglars. While there are many different options when it comes to these systems, their primary concept is twofold:

1. To deter predators from ever attempting to enter your home.

2. To alert the homeowner, and often the local authorities, about any attempted or successful burglary.

3. To record evidence for law enforcement. (Video footage can help identify aÂ thief, which in turn can help catch them and get any lost property returned to you!)
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3484" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></p>
Statistically, your home is less likely to be targeted if criminals know that a home security system is in place. Time and opportunity are two of the biggest factors in predators' minds when choosing a target. If they see that your home is difficult to enter, or that they'll have to circumvent a loud alarm system, they're much more likely to move on to a home that is less secure. (To this end, it is a good idea to place stickers on your windows or small signs in your front yard stating that you have a security system in place.)

Hopefully, signaling that you have an alarm system in place is enough to protect your home. However, if a burglar is more advanced, or has some deeper motivation for entering your space, then the security system you choose becomes much more important.

In my own experience, installing a variety of products that increase the security profile of your home is the best way to go.

&nbsp;
<h2>Options in the Home Security Market: What System is Right for You?</h2>
&nbsp;

There are many options within the home security market, and you'll find a wide range of opinions about which are best for ensuring your home's safety. These options have expanded tenfold in recent years with the advent of smart home technology.

The two biggest options within these systems are:

<strong>1. Professional Installation vs. Out-of-the-Box.Â </strong>More traditional and complex systems may require a professional installation, though even larger companies usually offer an out-of-the-box option for users who feel they can manage their own installation. Smart home security hubs typically fall under the out-of-the-box category, but installation is often quite simple.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Pros of professional installation</strong>: The system will be installed easily and you can be sure that it will work correctly. A professional can provide insight into what products you need, and you'll have someone to call if things stop working properly.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pros of out-of-the-box installation</strong>: You'll be more aware of how the products work, and installation is typically a fairly simple DIY project. You'll also usually spend less money, and can choose specific products that you know your home needs rather than being sold too much by an employee working on commission.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>2. Professional Home Monitoring vs. Smart Phone Application Monitoring.Â </strong>Additionally, you can choose between having a company manage your home security device (ie, popular options like <a href="http://www.frontlinesecurity.com" target="_blank">Frontline</a> and <a href="http://www.adthouseprotection.com" target="_blank">ADT</a>) or you can manage the system independently with a smart phone application.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Pros of Professional Home Monitoring</strong>: You'll have a extra set of eyes on your home at all times, and in the event that you are somehow unable to respond to a threat (if you are traveling, Â or somehow incapacitated) this is a fail-safe option.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pros of Smart Phone Application Monitoring</strong>: This is a less expensive option, and allows you to have more control over watching your own home. Some people don't like the idea of giving their home's access to a major company, and are more comfortable taking matters into their own hands. Additionally, professional monitoring systems have a high rate of false alarms (anything from high winds to a pet can accidentally set off an alarm.) If the police are called to your home for multiple false alarms you could be fined. Smart home monitoring allows you to make the judgement call on calling the authorities.</li>
</ul>
I consider myself to be fairly tech-savvy, but certainly not a master of new technology. I am also someone who likes to be in control of my own home and the products within it. Because of this, going the route of smart home monitoring rather than relying solely on a third party company made the most sense.

&nbsp;
<h2>Average Pricing for Home Security Systems</h2>
&nbsp;

If you're looking at a professionally installed and monitored system, you could also be looking at spending quite a bit. <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2013/09/09/the-cost-of-keeping-your-home-safe" target="_blank">Average costs</a> of equipment installation from larger companies range from $600 - $1,200, though sometimes you can find a good introductory sale. After the installation, the average cost for monthly home monitoring fees is $30, which works out to about $360/year.

If you've decided to go the out-of-the-box route, there are a variety of products that you can choose from which will add to your expenses, though a basic system is considerably less than one from one of the larger companies. We've chosen products that display the range of options that smart home security systems cover today. As we mentioned, building your own system in this way allows you to choose items which are specific to your home and customize your security capabilities.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3485" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/4.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></p>

<h2>Control Center Hubs</h2>
&nbsp;

Smart home automation control centers help you to manage multiple devices, even many from different companies, through one central controller. If you're going to choose from a variety of security devices--which is likely, because different companies have different technologies featured in their products--having this primary controller will save you time and make your home feel truly automated.

Think of it as a "universal remote control" for your entire home.

We've chosen two control centers that can work independently or in tandem with each other.

<a href="https://ideaing.com/ideas/01/20/in-home-personal-assistants-meet-the-smart-speaker" target="_blank">We've covered the Echo previously, as a "smart personal assistant,"</a> but it also has value as a smart home security hub. The Echo is compatible with a plethora of smart security products, and because of its growing popularity and easy ability to integrate with new technology, the number of products it pairs with will only continue to grow. This system also works with voice activation, which makes it easy to enable or disable your security system and any other products (smart lighting, et cetera) that work in conjunction with your entire smart home security setup.

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ideaing.com/open/91/idea" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3524" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/IMG_7965.jpg" alt="amazon-echo" width="500" height="667" /></a></p>
This is a very popular, well-reviewed device that works well with many systems. As mentioned above, one of its key selling points is that there is a great potential for even more compatibility with new devices in the coming years which makes this a good bet for a long-term purchase.

Having a central hub that allows you to control other aspects of your home security system allows you to experience true automation in your home. This is a product that will tie your whole system together!

Compatible with the Amazon Echo, the Wink hub allows you to integrate many security products (any that connect to "Z-wave" technology)Â so that they may be controlledÂ through one device. Wink has a smartphone application that allows users to monitor and manage many of the security devices we've included on this list. Many Amazon Echo users also purchase the Wink to give themselves additional control of their security devices.

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ideaing.com/open/796/idea" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3486" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/2.jpg" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
The compatibility with Amazon Echo is a great bonus, but this product could also stand on its own as a great addition to you smart home security system's functionality.

As discussed with the Echo, a central hub is really what makes your security system complete. There are so many products on the market that work with Z-wave technology, and more are being added all the time.

&nbsp;
<h2>Sensors</h2>
&nbsp;

While many people think of a home security system as the main "box" that users type their passwords into when they enter their homes, the real working parts of a security system are its sensors.

These devices monitor motion; whether the opening of a door or window, or a detector that catches movement in a room likely to be invaded first like your foyer. Big security companies like ADT will often ask new users what sensors they think they need: windows that might be vulnerable to burglars, doors people could break in through. If you're setting up your own system, you should ask yourself similar questions that these professional companies would. What areas of your home are most vulnerable? Choose your sensors from there.

<strong>Sensor Installation:Â </strong>These devices are relatively simple to install. Sensors typically come with two pieces each: the larger of which will go on the door frame or wall side of a window, while the smaller one will go on the movable door or window itself. Many of these devices come with an adhesive that can directly stick to the surface of your target area, which is very easy to work with, or for a slightly more permanent choice you can screw the devices into the wall.

If your goal is to create a personalized smart home security system, the GoControl suite of products is a great place to start. Inexpensive and easy to install, this line has a variety of options to choose from based on your personalized security concerns. This "essentials" kit comes with door sensors and a motion detector, all of which connect to the Wink Hub application and can easily be controlled from your smartphone. Additional options within the same line of products include door locks and sensors designed for different areas of your home.

<em>Compatible withÂ the Wink Hub.</em>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ideaing.com/open/797/idea" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3487" title="https://ideaing.com/product/gocontrol-wnk01-311kit-premium-z-wave-home-security-suite" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/8.jpg" alt="gocontrol-wnk01-311kit-premium-z-wave-home-security-suite" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
These products are a great example of how setting up your own smart home security suite can save you money, while also allowing for extra customization. Sensors are the basis of home security, and the easiest way to tell if an intruder has broken in through a doorway or window. This system allows you to have a more "traditional" alarm system in place but with customization and smart home functionality.

<h2>Entryway Security</h2>
&nbsp;

The two places a burglar is most likely to target are your ground-level doors and garage door. Adding extra protection to these areas will go a long way in preventing a predator from even considering you home. The following two products are simple to install, and will boost your home security and the visibility of that system to potential threats.

As you've probably realized, securing the major points of entry in your home is the main focus of home security systems. This is logical, of course, these are the places most vulnerable to entry because they are assumed to be the easiest to destabilize. This smart lock allows you to connect your front door's lock to your smartphone, so that you can lock or unlock your door from a distance.

Additionally, you can give out special codes (up to 30) to anyone who needs access to your home at certain times of the day. For example, if you want your housekeeper to have access to the home only in the afternoons, you can set their code to allow access from only 1 - 4 pm. Or, if you want to revoke access from a previous code, that can be done as well. This means you won't have to give out keys to neighbors or your children, which can create security vulnerabilities if keys are lost or misused. This method is also popular with AirBnB hosts, who want to let guests into their home for a temporary period without having to hand out keys that could easily be copied.

You'll also be able to make sure your doors are locked while you are away, no more fretting over whether you forgot to lock the front door!

<em>Compatible withÂ the Wink Hub.</em>

This is a great way to add extra security to your door, one of the more vulnerable places in your home, especially if you have a lot of people coming and going from your home while you are away. We also always love a device that uses remote capabilities to eliminate worry from your life, knowing that your doors are locked can give you a great deal of peace of mind.

Statistically, your garage is the most vulnerable entryway into your home. (It's also most likely the door that you're constantly trying to rememberÂ if you closed or not.) This Chamberlain device lets you know whether or not your garage is currently open, and also allows you to open or close it remotely from anywhere. Additionally, if you've closed your garage and it opens unexpectedly, which could indicate a break-in, the device will notify you of that as well.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ideaing.com/open/146/idea" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3526" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/MyQ-control.jpg" alt="MyQ-control" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
This is a great solution for anyone who worries about their garage door as a security vulnerability. That concern is warranted considering how many break-ins begin with garages. This device would also work well in conjunction with a full-scale security system.

<h2 id="title" class="a-size-large a-spacing-none">Security Lighting</h2>
&nbsp;

Lighting may not seem like an important factor in security, but it is. As we've mentioned in this article, one of the biggest factors in your home security system is its visibility. You want potential threats to see that your home is well-protected before they ever try breaking in. The ideal situation is that an attempted break-in never happens, because you home seems too difficult to access.

A well-lit home does several things to make your home look impenetrable:
<ul>
 	<li>A lit home looks occupied. Most burglars don't want to break into a home where people are home.</li>
 	<li>A lit home is easy for outsiders to see, which means that burglars have to worry about your neighbors seeing them committing this crime.</li>
</ul>
You have several options in smart home security lighting. The more technically advanced version involves lightbulbs or electrical outlets that you can turn on and off remotely through your smartphone. These systems can light your home from the inside and outside, making it truly appear that your family is home.

A less expensive, and easier to install, automated lighting system involves solar powered lights that automatically turn on when they sense motion. These are used outdoors, and have their own advantages and disadvantages. In the pro column: they're much less expensive and require almost no installation skills or upkeep. On the downside: they're often not as bright as larger lighting setups, and lighting your home from the inside can be more effective in convincing burglars that you are in the house.

If you're looking for a basic, inexpensive addition to your home's security arsenal, this solar powered sensor light is an excellent choice. Powered by light from the sun, there are no wires required so setup for this item is as easy as nailing the device to your outdoor walls. At night, if any motion is detected, the light will illuminate automatically. While this may seem very basic, a light flipping on is known to startle potential predators away.Â This is aÂ very simple, but effective, way to add security to your home with ease.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ideaing.com/open/798/idea" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3488" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/6.jpg" alt="mpow-super-bright-20-led-solar-powered-outdoor-light" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
A well-lit home is a safe home, and the motion sensors on this product also create an element of surprise to deter criminals. For the price, this device is a no-brainer.

This Hue light bulb by Philips is, first of all, a wonderful way to control your home's look and feel. The light bulb's brightness and color can be controlled through your mobile device or a control hub, which allows you to alter the look of any room in your home with the push of a button. Why is this a security asset? Because you'll also be able to control the lights in your home from a distance. Let's say you're delayed getting home one night and you know your house is dark. You can turn on the lights in your living room so the house will be lit when you get home. Burglars are much more likely to target a dark home, because when the lights are on they assume someone is home.

The benefits of this light bulb are twofold: you'll be able to make your home look occupied to deter potential security threats, and you get the added aesthetic bonus of being able to change your lights' colors. You'll also enjoy this product's compatibility with central hubs, turning off your lights at home with just the sound of your voice.

Another way to turn on the lights when you're not home is through a smart outlet. This Leviton device allows you to remotely turn lamps and small appliances on and off through a remote device, or through your home's central hub (it is compatible with both the Amazon Echo and WinkÂ devices.) This device can also assist you with another aspect of home security: the threat of damage to your home from accidentally leaving a hot device like a coffee pot or curling iron on. You'll be able to manage the power on those devices remotely, much in the same way that the Chamberlain garage door control works.

Another device that gives you a lot of bang for your buck. You'll get additional home automation, and also allow yourself the ability to turn on lights to deter threats much in the way the Philips Hue does.

If you don't want to install a completely new outlet, this iHome device gives you similar control to the Leviton device and plugs directly into an existing outlet. This product partners well with the Amazon Echo, Wink, and Siri on your iPhone. While you may like the overall look of an installed outlet for long-term use, this device might be a good way to try out this technology without the commitment of an installation. It will also work with outdoor outlets, which you may not be able to replace with something like the Leviton.

Having control of outdoor lights is especially important where home security is concerned. Many people leave subtle decorative lights around their housesÂ to, again, give the impression that people are home in the evening even when they may not be. Being able to turn these lights on while you are away is a valuable security asset. From a convenience perspective, you'll also be able to turn the lights off at night without having to venture outdoors to manually power them down.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ideaing.com/open/799/idea" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3530" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/iPlug.png" alt="ihome-isp5-wifi-smart-plug-for-apple-homekit" width="600" height="338" /></a></p>
This is a good option for anyone looking to try out a remote outlet. It also has a wide range of compatibility with well-known hubs, and the ability to plug into any outlet (even outdoor receptacles which cannot be permanently altered with installed outlets) makes it a worthwhile addition to your security suite.

&nbsp;
<h2>Security Cameras</h2>
&nbsp;

Unfortunately, many seasoned burglars have "seen it all" Â when it comes to smart home security systems. They even know how to break through some of the professionally installed setups. Having a good camera setup changes the game in favor of the homeowner. If you can catch a thief in the act, or right before they break into your home, you have a huge piece of evidence against them.
<p style="text-align: left;">Wireless camera systems allow you to connect to your smartphone and monitor the activity around your home via your smartphone 24/7. These systems also allow you to save all of your video footage to a cloud account where you can review it if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As far as camera placement, a good rule of thumb is that any area where you've chosen to place a sensor would also benefit from a single camera. So, if you've attached a sensor to both your front door and windows, you could also include one camera to monitor that entire front entryway area.</p>
&nbsp;

The ability to see what's going on outside your doors, or inside rooms of your home, is a huge asset to your home security setup. This Nest product is moderately priced, and can also be ordered from Amazon in a pack of 3 for $497. The device connects with your smartphone, which allows you to get updates about your home in real time. Motion sensors will notify you anytime there is movement by your front door, or anywhere else you place one of these little gadgets. It also has night vision capabilities, so that you can see what's going on outside while you're upstairs in your bedroom.

Nest also offers a <a href="https://nest.com/support/article/What-are-the-pricing-differences-for-Nest-Aware-subscription-plans" target="_blank">monthly upgrade package</a> that will allow 24/7 continuous video recording, as well as an up to 30-day history of those recordings. This can be especially helpful if youÂ <em>doÂ </em>experience a break-in or vandalism outside your home, because video recordings can catch the perpetrator and be valuable in working with the police to bring them to justice.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ideaing.com/open/55/idea" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3525" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/IMG_7961.jpg" alt="nest-security-cam" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
Cameras with motion sensor capabilities are an excellent way to make your smart home security suite more comprehensive, and Nest's line of products has a great reputation. Having the option of a 24/7 cloud recording of your security footage is also a huge boost to your security system's effectiveness.

Ever have an unknown person ring your doorbell at night? If you're home alone, this can be frightening and you likely don't want to open the door for a stranger. This doorbell/security camera combo is a great remedy to this problem. As soon as someone shows up at the front door, you'll get a notification on your smartphone along with a live video of your visitor. You can even communicate with them through a microphone without ever opening the door. This is quite helpful for package drop-offs, and generally monitoring who is coming in and out of your home throughout the day. Taking this a step further,Â this product allows you to monitor your front door from anywhere in the world with a wi-fi connection. You can essentially be "at home" even when you're on vacation, so your home won't appear vulnerable even when you're far away.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ideaing.com/open/115/idea" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3489" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/7.jpg" alt="Ring Doorbell" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
This is a very innovative device that makes sense as an addition to your security suite. Not only will you be able to monitor your door for security purposes while you are away from home, you'll also be able to avoid opening the door for home deliveries which some people believe is also a threat.

From the same company that makes the doorbell camera we covered above, this stick-up camera is a good companion piece to that device. This can be placed anywhere around your home, near your front door or backyard for example, and works similarly to its sister doorbell device. You'll be notified via smartphone whenever the camera detects motion, and you can communicate with anyone in the camera's range through a microphone. These are also weather-resistant and are wireless which makes them very easy to install.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ideaing.com/open/801/idea" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3510" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/13.jpg" alt="Ring camera" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
A good companion piece to the innovative Ring Doorbell device. If you'd like to have the same line of products for your smart home security camera system, this is a good addition to that product. Having cameras near any vulnerable areas of your home allows you to fully monitor your house whether you are inside or away from home.

If you choose to create your own custom smart home security system, you'll find yourself with a lot of options. These new technologies can help you feel more secure in your home, and can allow you peace of mind through remote monitoring when you're away.

Building a system of your own can be done through fairly simple installations. The upfront cost could range from very inexpensive, to quite costly depending on what you think your needs are. For instance, if you wanted to purchase one of every product on the list above, you'd spend about $1,400. However, your monthly maintenance fees would be less than with a professional security company, and you may feel that you have more control over your own security by monitoring it yourself rather than leaving it to a big corporation. Where cost is concerned, remember that you can always build your system up over time, starting with simple sensors and eventually adding cameras and lighting.

Adding security features to my own home has added a great deal of peace of mind to my life, and has also made managing the day-to-day security needs of my house much simpler. If you're considering a smart home security system, IÂ hope this article helped you make some important choices about how to get the right products for your home!

Luckily for you, thereâ€™s a new affordable smart oven that fixes really good meals automatically in less time than it takes for you to slip into something more comfortable. You chef tonight is Tovala.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<em>Disclosure: Tovala invited me to try a meal made from their new smart oven at their LaunchParty at the swanky WeWork office space in SF. </em>

The <a href="https://ideaing.com/product/tovala-oven">Tovala</a>Â oven is funky new cooking device that is really hard to define â€“ so Iâ€™m going to call it a â€˜smart ovenâ€™. The oven has been a rising star on<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1492357784/tovala-the-smart-oven-that-makes-home-cooking-easy/description"> Kickstarter</a>. Itâ€™s about the size of a microwave, but has four cooking functions: bake, broil, convection, and steam.

Pre-prepped meals are loaded into the oven and cooking procedures are automatically followed by swiping the barcodes on the top of each package. Meals can be pre-loaded and set to cook via timer, or started manually with their app. Homemade recipes can be made by dialing in settings on their app as well.

At the party, Tovala provided a three course meal consisting of stuffed chicken breast, macaroni and cheese, and asparagus.

&nbsp;

<a href="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/Tovala-Chicken-1000-x-500.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3569"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3569" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/04/Tovala-Chicken-1000-x-500.jpg" alt="Tovala Chicken In Oven" width="700" height="350" /></a>

The chicken breast was amazing â€“ the chicken itself was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside, and the stuffing inside added a really rich flavor. I couldnâ€™t believe how well they got the macaroni texture with the noodles being perfectly soft with a crispy top layer.

The asparagus had a good flavor, but the cooking time makes them a bit soft for my liking. One of the Tovala people I spoke to said that sheâ€™ll sometimes prepare the asparagus with an item that has a shorter cook time to keep them a bit more al dente.

Overall I think that the meal itself was excellent and definitely a lot better than I expected. Tovala is putting a lot of work into creating premade meals for users to purchase. I can imagine that stocking up on a weekâ€™s worth of these meals is something that busy people like me could learn to rely on for regular healthy and flavorful dinners.

What made me really excited though is how Tovala is looking to curate a community for DIY recipes. Users can make their own meals and upload recipes for others to try. Given that their oven has four cooking methods for home chefs to experiment with, I think it would be a lot of fun to see what I could come up with.

The best part is that if the community really likes a DIY recipe, then Tovala will make it an official meal for sale and give the original creator a cut of the revenue. Thereâ€™s some motivation for you to be creative!

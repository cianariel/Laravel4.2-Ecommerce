I've seen how effective <a href="https://ideaing.com/ideas/ideas-use-wifi-smart-switch-outlet">smart outlets are already</a>, but hadn't even considered how useful it would be to control the primary lights in my home rather than just the small lamps and appliances that plug into a smart outlet.

The Switchmate allows you to bring your existing home electrical system up-to-date with smart home technology without any difficulties.

Last week, I installed a Switchmate Light Switch in my home. "Installed" is actually a pretty liberal term here as the installation and functionality of this device isÂ <em>beyondÂ </em>simple, making it an excellent choice for users who are new to smart home products.

&nbsp;

The Switchmate allows you to control your existing light switches remotely through an application on your cell phone. You can easily set timers for your lights through the SwitchmateÂ App, which is especially useful if you want to automatically turn your lights on at night for safety reasons. You can also enable the device to monitor your location, so that your lights turn on when you arrive at your house or off when you depart.

&nbsp;
<h2>Installation</h2>
&nbsp;

The Switchmate requires basically nothing in terms of installation, as illustrated in the video below.
<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rRyU_VahVkc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
&nbsp;

At $39.99, the Switchmate is incredibly affordable, which is great because you'll likely want one for multiple switches in your home! If you're curious about Switchmate Light Switches, read on to learn aboutÂ several ways that this product can make your home smarter and more functional!

&nbsp;
<h2>Control outdoor lighting automatically.</h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7941 size-large" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-27-17_49_10-How-to-Install-and-Use-a-Switchmate-Light-Switch-YouTube-700x339.png" alt="Outdoor Lights with Switchmate" width="700" height="339" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Set timers onÂ your outdoor lights to keep your home safe!</strong></p>
&nbsp;

When I installed my own <a href="https://ideaing.com/product/switchmate-one-second-smart-home-light-switch" target="_blank">Switchmate</a>, using it on the interior switch that controls my porch
light was at the top of my priority list. Being able to control the porch light at night adds a level of security that gives me relief if I'm running late in the evening and all the lights are off in my house. In fact, I went ahead and set a daily timer that switches the light on automatically at sunset and then off again at sunrise.

&nbsp;
<h2>Automatically turn on &amp; offÂ Garage lights.</h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7942 size-large" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-27-17_50_44-How-to-Install-and-Use-a-Switchmate-Light-Switch-YouTube-700x330.png" alt="Garage Lights with Switchmate" width="700" height="330" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Never lose your way in a dark garage again!</strong></p>
&nbsp;

Another frustrating light situation that I encounter in my own home is in our garage. When the door to our particular garage opens at night, the only light that shines is a very small one on the ceiling. That light is not enough when I need to, say, carry bags of groceries inside in the dark. We do have very nice, bright lights available in our garage, but they can only be turned on from a switch inside the house. That isn't very helpful when I'm rummaging around in the dark! With Switchmate, I could set the garage light switch to automatically turn on whenever I return home. A location sensor in the application will trigger the switch as soon as I'm close to home, and I won't be stuck making my way through a sea of darkness!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2>MakeÂ inconvenientÂ lights to more convenient lights.</h2>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7943 size-large" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-27-17_50_06-How-to-Install-and-Use-a-Switchmate-Light-Switch-YouTube-700x330.png" alt="Easily Reach Awkward Switches with Switchmate" width="700" height="330" />
<strong>Giving "clap on"/"clap off" a new meaning.</strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;">Another issue I encounter with my own light switches is that some of them are located in inconvenient places. For example, the light that hangs over the mid-stair landing in our house is controlled by a switch downstairs. Almost every night, I forget to turn it off before heading upstairs (which is logical in a way, because it is easier to see my way up the stairs with the light on...) and then have to walk back downstairs to turn it off. Not that one extra trip downstairs does me any harm, but being able to control the light through my phone would certainly add an extra layer of convenience.</p>
&nbsp;
<h2>Turn on the light for late-night visitors.</h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8302" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0888-700x525.jpg" alt="IMG_0888" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Illuminate delivery people or unfamiliar visitors in the dark for added security.Â </strong></p>
&nbsp;

Whether you've ordered a late-night pizza or a friend has decided to swing by for a late night Netflix binge, being able to see who is at your front door is important to your security. It also ensures that your visitor will be able to see themselves to your front door safely, without having to find their way in the dark.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2>Energy savings, money savings.</h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7945" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/image1.png" alt="Turn off all your lights at once with Switchmate" width="394" height="700" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Make sure all of your lights are off when you don't need to use them!</strong></p>
&nbsp;

Finally, if you install multiple Switchmates in your home (and we think you'll want to once you try one) you'll be able to switch offÂ <em>allÂ </em>of the lights in your application with the touch of a single button. No leaving a stray light on and wasting money and energy!

Well, you can be. Not knowing if your home is safeÂ and sound while you are away, whether for a quick trip to the mall or a longer vacation, can be a major source of stress. In years past, setting up a quality home monitoring system was expensive and difficult from an installation perspective. The Blink Home Monitoring System offers a solution that is affordable, but also simple to install and use. I installed the system in my own home last week.

It has already made me feel more secure and in control of what is going on in my own home. For example, my husband and I often worry about leaving our dog alone at home. With the Blink system, we're able to check in on her while we're out at dinner or a movie and see that she's doing just fine! The ability has allowed us to enjoy more stress-free evenings. I can only imagine how much more enjoyable it would make longer vacations!

<h4>What is the Blink Home Monitoring System?</h4>
A smart video camera system that allows you to check in on your home from anywhere. The system utilizes both video and sound monitoring via your smartphone and connects to your existing home Wi-Fi network.

&nbsp;
<h4>Why you need it</h4>
You'll be constantly connected to your home; to check in on everything from security, pets, children, and appliances. Worried you accidentally left a burner on your stove running? The Blink system provides an incredibly clear video (it even lets you zoom in on specific spots) so you can check in on every detail in your home. We'd also recommend placing one of your Blink cameras in a location that allows you to see outdoors to your front and back yards. This is a great way to double-check on security around your home, whether you are in the house or away.

&nbsp;
<h4>Installation Ease of Use</h4>
The Blink system is incredibly simple to install, and depending on where you choose to place your cameras the entire installation can easily be completed in 15 minutes or less.
Take a look at the video below to learn more about the installation process, along with a few tips for using your Blink system.

&nbsp;
<div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ErHVQmapYlU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
&nbsp;
<h4>Cost</h4>
Blink systems begin at just $99 for a one-camera system and top out at $339 for a five-camera suite. This is a very reasonable price for such an innovative system.
Using the Blink Home Monitoring System in my own home has given me some insight into how it might help you in your own house! Read on to hear my tips for using the system.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Outdoor Security Monitoring</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7952" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_8518-700x525.jpg" alt="Make sure no one is bothering your front door with the Blink Home Monitoring System" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Make sure your home isn't being targeted by intruders by remotely checking in with your front door!Â </strong></p>
The Blink Home Monitoring System is easy to set up in any spot in your home, but probably the first place you'll want to install a camera is facing your front yard. We recommend positioning the camera itself on the inside of a front-facing window. That way, you'll be able to see what's happening in your front yard withoutÂ thieves stealing your camera (often an issue with outdoor cameras!)

You'll be able to check in on your front yard remotely, no matter where you are in the world as long as you have access to Wi-Fi. Even if you're just upstairs in your bedroom at night this sort of camera can be useful. Hear an unusual sound? Don't take the risk opening the front door to check it out, just take a peek at your Blink app for peace of mind. There's even an option to turn on a light for a clear picture in the dark of night!

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kitchen Safety</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7951" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_8519-700x525.jpg" alt="Check in on your home appliances with the Blink Home Monitoring Systme" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Don't spend all day worrying you left a burner on your stove running, double-check with the click of a button.Â </strong></p>
&nbsp;

If you're a worrier (like me) you probably spend a lot of time thinking about whether you turned off various appliances in your kitchen. It's important to be aware of a burner accidentally left on, or even a boiling pot of water left on the stove. These are potential fire and health hazards, after all.
One of the best thing about the Blink system is that it provides an extremely clear video quality which allows you to see your home in detail. You can even zoom in on specific places (like your stove top) to get a better view if necessary.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Baby, Kid, and Pet Monitor</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7950" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/IMG_8520-700x525.jpg" alt="Monitor your children &amp; pets with the Blink Home Monitoring System" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Blink Home Monitoring System will likely confirm what you've suspected all along... your furry friends spend most of their time waiting for you to come back home!Â </strong></p>
&nbsp;

The Blink system would actually make an effective baby monitor, and is a great option for new parents who want a monitor for their child as well as for their entire home. The system not only allows you to see what's going on with your kids, or your pets, it also allows you to listen to the sounds coming from your home as well. If your child is crying, or your dog is barking, you'll know!

Our young puppy, Buffy, is just now transitioning from being crated when we leave home to having free reign of the house. The Blink system has been a huge help in this transition, as being able to check in on her eases our minds and gives us confidence that she's capable of roaming the house on her own!

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Vacation Reassurance</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7949" src="https://ideaing-ideas.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/06/2016-06-27-19_12_05-How-to-Install-Use-the-Blink-Home-Monitoring-System-YouTube-700x329.png" alt="Blink will put your mind at ease on vacation" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Spending your vacation worrying about the home you left behind? Blink, and you're there!</strong></p>
When asked what the most stressful part of taking a vacation is, most people would likely respond that it is worrying about what's happening at their home. With Blink, you're able to take a quick peek at each room in your home periodically throughout your trip. Once you know everything is okay, you'll be able to return to your trip with a greater sense of relaxation.

We think the Blink Home Monitoring System will give you a great feeling of security and control over your home. The low cost and easy installation are the cherry on top of an already amazing sundae! This is the kind of product that people who are new to the smart home market can understand and use easily, and will open your eyes to the potential of making your <a href="https://ideaing.com/ideas/protect-yourself-from-home-invasions">home security more technologically advanced</a>. Also what makes this Security camera better than most is it's battery powered (Blink promises close to a year), so it's completely wireless and not tied to a power cord.

As I was sitting on the beach with a few friends this past weekend, we were reminiscing about the days when there use to be heaps of snow in the winter and mild summer evenings in July and August.
&nbsp;
Now, say what you will about global warming, butÂ <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/weather-climate/temperature.html">2014 was the warmest year on record worldwide</a> - and 2005â€“2014 was the warmest decade on record since thermometer-based observations began. It's clear that our planet is only increasing in temperature (that's a whole other blog post...) and we need to figure out ways to beat the heat fast.</p>
<p class="p3">When it comes to smart products, there are a ton of products that can do the trick to help beat the heat. And when it comes to tips and tricks for selecting these smart products, there are plenty of those, too.</p>
<p class="p3">Beating the heat with smart devices can make your life so much easier, so here's...</p>
&nbsp;
<strong>Why You Need It</strong></p>
Why should you use smart products to beat the heat, you ask? Easy. Smart products that connect with your smartphone make it so much easier to prepare your home (you know, making it cool) while you're on your way home from work. Instead of leaving your AC on all day, for example, you can set it to turn off when you leave your home and use an associated app to turn it back on as you're driving home from the office. And this is just one example. You need smart products to beat the heat because it'll make your life so much easier.</p>
So when you're having the same epiphany as I did while I was on the beach with friends this past weekend, remember this blog post - and read on forÂ ways to beat the heat with smart devices.</p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Having a Wi-Fi air conditioner allows you to turn your system on and off, even when you're away from home.</strong></p>
&nbsp;

I use a Wi-Fi air conditioning system in my home because I hate wasting energy (and money). Using a Wi-FiÂ air conditioner, you can control when you're using the product and turn it off, even when you're away from home. It allows you only to control your air conditioning when you need it.

I use my system when I'm on my way home from work. I dislike sleeping with it on, so I typically turn it off at night (unless it's super hot). Since my apartment faces the sun as it's setting, it can get super hot in the evening - so when I'm driving home from the office, I turn on the device using my smartphone.

Below are some options you can use at home:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fans that can be controlled from other rooms will allow you to turn your fan on/off with ease.</strong></p>
&nbsp;

Ceiling fans are for those (like myself, sometimes) who dislike having air conditioning on all the time. There are some people who can have respiratory issues with AC, especially if they're in or around it frequently. You know those people who always get sick on air planes or in hotels rooms? It's often because of too much AC.

So, for those of us who want to turn their home into a smart home and beat the heat with smart devices, but don't want to use AC frequently, smart Wi-FiÂ fans are for you. Look for a fan that comes with an associated appÂ or a remote controlÂ so you can monitor and control your productÂ from other rooms.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Smart thermostats allow users to control the temperature of their home right from their smartphone.</strong></p>
&nbsp;

In my area of the continent, temperature can turn on the fly. I've once gone to bed on a gorgeous night, with the sun setting brilliantly, only to wake-up and find that the beautiful night turned to thundershowers and lighting as a I was sleeping.

This same thing can happen while you're gone during the day, or perhaps when you're away for days at a time. And when this happens, you want the ability the control the temperature of your home on the fly.

That's why smart thermostats are so great. They allow you to control the temperatures of your room and home right from an associated smartphone app.

Below are some of my picks:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lighting generates a ton of excess heat, so turning them off while you're away willÂ normalizeÂ the temperatureÂ in your home.</strong></p>
&nbsp;

Could you imagine having the ability to turn on and off your lighting while you're away from home? For example, if you're at work and you think you might have forgotten to turn off your bedroom lighting, wouldn't it be great if you could check the status from the comfort of your smartphone?

Many of us forget how much heat a light bulb emits. If you're using a traditional incandescent bulb,Â it (on average) produces about <a href="http://www.reptileuvinfo.com/html/watts-heat-lights-lamp-heat-output.html">2 watts of light and 98 watts of heat</a> for a 100 watt bulb. (That's pretty bad).

By using a light bulb that can be turned on and off while you're away, you'll save energy and overall heat emission.

Below are some of my favorite smart light bulbs:

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Controlling your blinds through your smartphone (or a remote control) gives you the ability to manage the temperature of various rooms in your home, dependent on the sunlight.</strong></p>
&nbsp;

I was always taught to keep my windows and blinds openÂ at night, then close them during the daytime when the sun got too warm. I thought it might have been an old wive's tale that my Mother tried to pass down until I grew up, got my own place and realized the hard way that she was right.

Now, I can have the option of controlling my blinds through my smartphone or a remote control because of brand new smart products on the market. They're pretty fantastic as some (like the Somfy above) can control your window coverings, awnings, screens and rolling shutters with a smartphone or tablet.

Dehydration can cause headaches, tiredness and loss of concentration - andÂ it can also normalize your internal body functions. It's so important to good health, and it's even more important to maintain overall daily hydration. That's why having water nearby at all times is necessary. Personally, I keep a water bottle with me all day - from my office to my car, and multiple while I'm at the gym.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Smart refrigerators and devices give you the ultimate control in smart functionality, letting you manage groceries, family connection and more from your smartphone.</strong></p>
&nbsp;

Staying connected with your refrigerator or other 'cold' products and devices allow you to keep your items cool in the long summer months - like water, ice, juices, icicles and more.

Smart refrigerators were all the rage at CES 2016, and companies like Samsung are expecting that these will become mainstream in the next few years. While they hold a heavy price tag and are quite limited in quantity at this time, I'm excited to see where this smart home industry goes in the next while.

Now, I don't mean to scare you - but <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/weather-climate/temperature.html">since 1901, the average surface temperature across the US States has risen at an average rate of 0.13Â°F per decade.</a> That's pretty scary, but what it really means is that, not only do we need to pay more attention to warming than ever, we need to consider how to keep ourselves cool in the long, hot summers.

With the number of smart products increasing month over month, we're certainly paying more attention to energy efficiency and our overall well-being, which means that now is the time to consider trying and testing smart devices to beat the heat before they become more mainstream in nature.
